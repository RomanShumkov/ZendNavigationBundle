# Zend Navigation Bundle

This bundle integrates Zend Navigation into Symfony2 by providing view helpers and symfony taylored page types.

## Installation

Put it into your bundle list:

    new Bundle\ZendNavigationBundle(),

Zend Framework is already a dependency of Symfony so this is all rather simple to use.
